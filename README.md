# About me

I'm passionate about web development, diving deep into frameworks like Ruby on Rails (Anyone still here?), React, and staying curious about the next big thing (there's always something new each year, so let's keep this spot open ;D).

Iâ€™m also enthusiastic about mastering cloud operations with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

Never stop being curious.
